export const JARGON_TEXT = `94.8% of the top one million websites fail basic accessibility standards. WebAIM's 2025 analysis found that pages using ARIA average 57 errors per page, compared to 27 for pages that don't use it — accessibility attributes applied incorrectly create more barriers than they remove. The standard response has been to layer retrofitted fixes on a broken foundation: bolting on screen reader compatibility post-launch, sprinkling ARIA attributes on codebases never designed to support them, and deferring structural remediation because it is more expensive than the original build. Multimodal AI changes the cost structure of this problem — not by making retrofitting cheaper, but by making the single fixed interface that needs to be retrofitted unnecessary. Models like Claude and Gemini accept any input and produce any output; the intelligence is constant, the format is a parameter. When accessibility is an architectural property rather than a feature, it is free at inference time.`
